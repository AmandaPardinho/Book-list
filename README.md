# Book catalog

## Abstract
> This project will simulate a library catalog and allow user interaction.
---

## Library
> In this project I create an interface that allows users to simulate the registration of new books to a library's catalog.
> For that I used java swing, a framework that provides a set of graphic elements to be used. In this library project I 
> specifically used JOptionPane to allow user interaction.
---

## Purpose, Problems, and Ending 
> In this project I wanted to perform some kind of interaction with the user. To do this, I used the JOptionPane, a  
> screen with a pre-defined layout. Even with this pre-defined layout, because I have never used it, I had some problems
> in the beginning for not knowing the exact command I should use to access the function that would help me execute the 
> planned for a certain screen. 
> After resolving which type of JOptionPane to use and what code to insert along with it, I had problems implementing 
> the logic that would be used for each action. Each time I modified the code so that the action would be performed, 
> either the screen would not appear, or the screen would appear in a loop and the program would not terminate.
> Finally, I managed to finish the program in a way that left me satisfied. The code still needs some changes and improvements,
> but it works well for the moment. In the future, as I further my studies, I plan to revisit and improve it to bring it
> closer to what I envisioned.
