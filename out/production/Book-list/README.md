# Book catalog

## Abstract
> This project will simulate a library catalog and allow user interaction.
---

## Library
> In this project I create an interface that allows users to simulate the registration of new books to a library's catalog.
> For that I used java swing, a framework that provides a set of graphic elements to be used. In this library project I 
> specifically used JOptionPane to allow user interaction.
